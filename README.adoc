STATE of this repo: Generally working, but being updated frequently. Still pretty brittle due to lots of hardcoded parameters.


Need to fix:
* Remove hardcoded references to RMT server
* Need to be able to pass helm server into admin node from within variables.tf file
* Need to be able to disable NFS server and NFS StorageClass from within variables.tf file
** Could also use cluster-deploy.sh to set keys/values in a file, b64 encode that file then sed it into the admin node cloud-init file

Dependencies:
* Must use RMT server as Helm server is colocated 

Deployment overview:
* Install Terraform
* Install the terraform-libvirt-provider
* Download the skuba repo
* Downlod this repo
* Copy the contents of this  repo into the skuba/ci/infra/libvirt directory
* Update terraform.tfvars file with specifics for you environment
* Ensure the local user has passwordless ssh to the libvirt user specified in .tfvars
* Ensure the libvirt user is in the libvirt group and has passwordless sudo privileges
* Start ssh-agent with the ssh key that provides passwordless ssh access
* Deploy with ./cluster-deploy.sh
* Destroy with ./cluster-destroy.sh
